leaders of organisations committed to ending violence against children we come together in solidarity to share our deep concern call for action and pledge our support to protect children from violence and reduce the impact of covid-19 on children in every country and community. a third of the global population is on covid-19 lockdown and school closures have impacted more than 1.5 billion children. movement restrictions loss of income isolation overcrowding and high levels of stress and anxiety are increasing the likelihood that children experience and observe physical psychological and sexual abuse at home particularly those children already living in violent or dysfunctional family situations. and while online communities have become central to maintain many childrens learning support and play it is also increasing their exposure to cyberbullying risky online behavior and sexual exploitation.the situation is aggravated by childrens lack of access to schoolfriends teachers social workers and the safe space and services that schools provide. the most vulnerable children including refugees migrants and children who are internally displaced deprived of liberty living without parental care living on the street and in urban slums with disabilities and living in conflict affected areas are a particular concern. for many growing economic vulnerability will increase the threat of child labour child marriage and child trafficking. we must act now. together we call on governments the international community and leaders in every sector to urgently respond with a united effort to protect children from the heightened risk of violence exploitation and abuse as part of the broader response to covid-19.governments have a central role to play. they must ensure that covid-19 prevention and response plans integrate age appropriate and gender sensitive measures to protect all children from violence neglect and abuse. child protection services and workers must be designated as essential and resourced accordingly. working with and supporting governments our collective response must include maintaining essential health and social welfare services including mental health and psychosocial support providing child protection case management and emergency alternative care arrangements ensuring social protection for the most vulnerable children and households continuing care and protection for children in institutions and communicating with and engaging parents caregivers and children themselves with evidence based information and advice. national helplines school counsellors and other child friendly reporting mechanisms enable children in distress to reach out for help and must be adapted to the challenges of covid-19. given the heightened risks of online harms technology companies and telecoms providers must do everything they can to keep children safe online. this includes providing access to cost free child helplines age appropriate services and safe e education platforms and using their platforms to share child online safety advice. they must also do more to detect and stop harmful activity against children online including grooming and the creation and distribution of child sexual abuse images and videos. as global organisations working to end violence against children we will continue to advocate for and invest in effective child protection solutions. we will collectively develop and share technical resources and guidance for policymakers practitioners parents caregivers and children themselves. and we will support the courageous health child protection and humanitarian professionals working around the clock to keep children safe during these unprecedented times. in recent years the global community has made significant gains in protecting children from violence. we must not allow those gains to be lost during the current turmoil. we must do all we can to keep children safe now. and we must plan ahead together so that once the immediate health crisis is over we can get back on track towards the goal of ending all forms of violence abuse and neglect of children.  the covid-19 pandemic is having a

212,"""Statement of the Twenty-Fourth IHR Emergency Committee"". the twenty fourth meeting of the emergency committee under the international health regulations 2005 ihr on the international spread of poliovirus was convened by the director general on 26 march 2020 with committee members only attending via teleconference supported by the who secretariat. in order to ease the burden on affected state parties in the exceptional situation following the determination of the covid-19 outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern pheic on 30 january 2020 characterized as a pandemic on 11 march 2020 the invited state parties were asked to present their reports electronically only instead of attending via teleconference. reports were received from afghanistan burkina faso central african republic cote divoire democratic republic of congo dr congo ethiopia ghana pakistan and philippines. the emergency committee reviewed the data on wild poliovirus wpv1 and circulating vaccine derived polioviruses cvdpv. the who secretariat presented a report of progress for affected ihr states parties subject to temporary recommendations. wild poliovirus the committee remains gravely concerned by the significant increase in wpv1 cases globally in 2019 and 2020 with 175 cases in 2019 compared to 33 in 2018 and already 32 cases as at 17 march 2020 compared to six for the same period in 2019 with no significant success yet in reversing this trend. in pakistan transmission continues to be widespread as indicated by both acute flaccid paralysis afp surveillance and environmental sampling. while the issues of vaccine hesitancy and refusals by individuals and communities and problems with management of the national polio program are being addressed these are yet to have impact on the current worrying epidemiology. the added pressure on the program due to detection of cvdpv2 and ongoing spread in several provinces see below has continued into 2020. in afghanistan the security situation remains very challenging. inaccessibility and missed children particularly in the southern region have led to a large cohort of susceptible children in this part of afghanistan. the risk of a major upsurge of cases is growing with other parts of the country that have been free of wpv1 for some time now at risk of outbreaks. this would again increase the risk of international spread. the committee noted that based on sequencing of viruses there were recent instances of international spread of viruses from pakistan to afghanistan and also from afghanistan to pakistan. the recent increased frequency of wpv1 international spread between the two countries suggests that rising transmission in pakistan and afghanistan correlates with increasing risk of wpv1 exportation beyond the single epidemiological block formed by the two countries. the committee noted the continued cooperation and coordination between afghanistan and pakistan particularly in reaching high risk mobile populations that frequently cross the international border and welcomed the all age vaccination now being taken at key border points between the two countries. vaccine derived poliovirus vdpv the multiple cirulating vdpv cvdpv outbreaks in four who regions african eastern mediterranean south east asian and western pacific regions are very concerning with two new countries reporting outbreaks since the last meeting malaysia and burkina faso. unlike historical experience cross border spread of cvdpv2 has become quite common with recent spread from angola to dr congo and zambia and from chad and car to cameroon and from ghana to burkina faso. in addition local emergences attributable to mopv2 use have recently occurred in togo chad and ethiopia. the committee noted that the gpei has published a strategy to address cvdpv2 outbreaks but was extremely concerned that the monovalent opv2 stockpile was still depleted. the committee strongly supports the development and proposed emergency use listing of the novel opv2 vaccine which should become available mid-2020 and which it is hoped will result in no or very little seeding of further outbreaks. impact of covid-19 the committee noted the very recent policy guidance of the gpei gpei recommendations for countries during the covid-19 pandemic. this document summarizes the recommendations from the polio oversight board meeting on 24 march 2020 which calls for postponement of both preventive and outbreak response campaigns while ensuring surveillance and nopv2 development and roll out plans continue in full. the covid-19 polio programme continuity plan. the operational guide was developed in collaboration with the regional polio eradication teams and the gpei partners to ensure essential gpei functions continue polio programme personnel and staff are kept safe and to plan for a fast and effective resumption of polio eradication activities including supplementary immunization activities as soon as the public health situation with covid-19 allows. the committee is extremely concerned about the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the risk of heightened transmission of polio and consequently the potential for international spread and significant reversal of polio eradication. conclusion the committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a public health emergency of international concern pheic and recommended the extension of temporary recommendations for a further three months. however noting that some if not many international borders are closed to prevent international spread of covid-19 state parties may not currently be able to enforce the temporary recommendations in all places. the committee strongly urges countries subject to these recommendations to maintain a high state of readiness to implement them as soon as possible ensuring the continued safety of travelers as well as health professionals. the committee recognizes the concerns regarding the lengthy duration of the polio pheic but concludes that the current situation is extraordinary with clear ongoing risk of international spread and ongoing need for coordinated international response. the committee considered the following factors in reaching this conclusion rising risk of wpv1 international spread the progress made in recent years appears to have reversed with the committees assessment that the risk of international spread is at the highest point since 2014 when the pheic was declared. this risk assessment is based on the following the wpv1 exportation in 2019 from pakistan to iran and to afghanistan and more recently spread from afghanistan to pakistan;ongoing rise in the number of wpv1 cases and positive environmental samples in pakistan and to a lesser extent afghanistan;the quickly increasing cohort of unvaccinated children in afghanistan with the risk of a major outbreak imminent if nothing is done to access these children;the urgent need to overhaul the leadership and strategy of the program in pakistan which although already commenced is likely take some time to lead to more effective control of transmission and ultimately eradication;increasing community and individual resistance to the polio program.rising risk of cvdpv international spread the clearly documented increased spread in recent months of cvdpv2 demonstrate the unusual nature of the current situation as international spread of cvdpv in the past has been very infrequent. the number of new emergences of cvdpv2 in africa raises further concern. the risk of new outbreaks in new countries is considered extremely high even probable. covid-19 this new and unprecedented pandemic is likely to substantially negatively impact the polio eradication program and outbreak control efforts. there is a risk of exportation of both wpv1 and cvdpv to known high risk countries to which it may take a lot of time and effort to adequately respond.falling pv2 immunity global population mucosal immunity to type 2 polioviruses pv2 continues to fall as the cohort of children born after opv2 withdrawal grows exacerbated by poor coverage with ipv particularly in some of the cvdpv infected countries.multiple outbreaks the evolving and unusual epidemiology resulting in rapid emergence and evolution of cvdpv2 strains is extraordinary and not yet fully understood and represents an additional risk that is yet to be quantified.weak routine immunization many countries have weak immunization systems that can be further impacted by various humanitarian emergencies including covid19 and the number of countries in which immunization systems have been weakened or disrupted by conflict and complex emergencies poses a growing risk leaving populations in these fragile states vulnerable to outbreaks of polio. surveillance gaps the appearance of highly diverged vdpvs in the philippines somalia and indonesia are examples of inadequate polio surveillance heightening concerns that transmission could be missed in various countries. furthermore the missed transmission in china for a year illustrates that even countries with generally good surveillance can miss vdpv transmission. covid-19 is likely to have a negative impact on polio surveillance also.lack of access inaccessibility continues to be a major risk particularly in several countries currently infected with wpv or cvdpv i.e. afghanistan nigeria niger somalia and myanmar which all have sizable populations that have been unreached with polio vaccine for prolonged periods.population movement the risk is amplified by population movement whether for family social economic or cultural reasons or in the context of populations displaced by insecurity and returning refugees. there is a need for international coordination to address these risks. a regional approach and strong crossborder cooperation is required to respond to these risks as much international spread of polio occurs over land borders.risk categoriesthe committee provided the director general with the following advice aimed at reducing the risk of international spread of wpv1 and cvdpvs based on the risk stratification as follows states infected with wpv1 cvdpv1 or cvdpv3 with potential risk of international spread.states infected with cvdpv2 with potential risk of international spread.states no longer infected by wpv1 or cvdpv but which remain vulnerable to re infection by wpv or cvdpv.criteria to assess states as no longer infected by wpv1 or cvdpv poliovirus case 12 months after the onset date of the most recent case plus one month to account for case detection investigation laboratory testing and reporting period or when all reported afp cases with onset within 12 months of last case have been tested for polio and excluded for wpv1 or cvdpv and environmental or other samples collected within 12 months of the last case have also tested negative whichever is the longer.environmental or other isolation of wpv1 or cvdpv no poliovirus case 12 months after collection of the most recent positive environmental or other sample such as from a healthy child plus one month to account for the laboratory testing and reporting periodthese criteria may be varied for the endemic countries where more rigorous assessment is needed in reference to surveillance gaps e.g. borno state nigeria)once a country meets these criteria as no longer infected the country will be considered vulnerable for a further 12 months. after this period the country will no longer be subject to temporary recommendations unless the committee has concerns based on the final report.  the twenty fourth meeting of the emergency committee under the international health regulations 2005 ihr on the international spread of poliovirus was convened by the director general on 26 march 2020 with committee members only attending via teleconference supported by the who
